# punchout

This is a companion program to the Fill-in-the-Blank Spaced Repetition Learning System (FITB SRL). What it does is take full sentences in a foreign language, and create "fill-in-the-blank" entries where each word is "punched out", meaning it is the answer the learner has to provide. Options allow for it to use line breaks instead of sentences (ideal for song lyrics) and breaking on commas. Output flags reptitious answers and indistinguishable question portions for manual review.
